# ðŸ“Œ Job Application Tracker Dashboard

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ This is a personal project I built to help keep track of my job applications â€” and maybe it can help you too. It started as a simple Excel sheet, and I decided to level it up with a dashboard and some Python-powered analytics. Now it's a full-on job search companion!

---

ðŸ”§ **What It Does:**
- Lets you log and track all your job applications in one place
- Gives you a clear view of where you're applying and how it's going
- Automatically analyzes trends like response time, success rate by platform, etc.
- Helps spot what's working and whatâ€™s not in your job search

---

ðŸ›  **Tools I Used:**
- **Excel**: For tracking, filtering, and dashboard charts
- **Python**: To automate analysis (with `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Script**: To generate clean visuals and breakdowns

---

ðŸ“ˆ **What Youâ€™ll See:**
- Pie chart of application status (Applied, Interviewing, Offer, etc.)
- Bar chart comparing platforms (LinkedIn vs Indeed, etc.)
- Weekly application trends
